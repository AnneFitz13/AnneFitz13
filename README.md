I am an associate professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Boston. I received my dual Ph.D. in Economics and Public Policy from the University of Michigan in 2015. My  research  focuses on health and education in developing countries. I specialize in conducting randomized evaluations aimed at testing policies to improve health care and education quality, with the ultimate goal of improving the well-being of individuals worldwide. I also have  ongoing research projects studying the financial impacts of large-scale health insurance expansions in the US with my sister Katie.

I teach courses in health economics, global health economics, quantitative methods (MA), and econometrics.
